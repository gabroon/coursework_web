          Introduction
        </H2>
        <P>
          A flag is a piece of fabric, often flown from a pole or mast,  generally used 
          symbolically for signaling or identification. It is most  commonly used to 
          symbolize a country. The term flag is also used to  refer to the graphic design 
          employed by a flag, or to its depiction in  another medium. Flags are also used 
          in messaging, advertising, or for  other decorative purposes. The study of flags 
          is known as  
          <STRONG>
            vexillology
          </STRONG>
          , from the Latin 
          <EM>
            vexillum
          </EM>
          
          meaning  flag or banner.

          The origin of modern flags lies in our remote prehistoric past. When  people 
          started to form large groups to live and hunt together, they  appointed a leader 
          to rule them and settle disputes. As a mark of office  this leader would wear 
          some sort of ceremonial head-dress and hold a  long decorative staff, rod or 
          spear, topped with an ornament or tribal  emblem. The staff was also used as a 
          visible sign to rally around, or to  point out the direction of a march or 
          attack. This prehistoric, or  proto-flag, is known as a vexilloid. 
        </P>
        <P>
          Later in Ancient China, a different tradition developed when silk was 
          invented between 6000 and 3000 BC. This strong, light fabric was ideal  for 
          making banners, which were much easier to carry than the vexilloids  that had 
          been used earlier, and they were also easier to see from a  distance. 
        </P>
        <P>
          From Ancient China the use of fabric flags spread to Mongolia, Japan,  Korea, 
          India, Persia, Ancient Greece, and finally the Roman Empire and  the rest of 
          Europe.
        </P>
        <P>
          During the Middle Ages, flags were used for a variety of purposes  including: 
          identification of members of nobility, guilds, cities,  religious worship, and 
          for use during battles. In battle, flags were  used by military companies for 
          identification on the field and relaying  of strategic instructions. 
        </P>
        <P>
          From the era of sailing vessels onwards, it has been customary (and  later a 
          legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their  nationality. 
          These flags eventually evolved into the national flags and  maritime flags of 
          today. Flags also became the preferred means of  communications at sea, 
          resulting in various systems of flag signals (see

            One of the most popular uses of a flag is to symbolize a nation or  country. 
            Some national flags have been particularly inspirational to  other nations, 
            countries, or subnational entities in the design of their  own flags.

              The Tricolour of The Netherlands is the oldest tricolor, first appearing

          The system of international maritime signal flags is a way of representing 
          individual letters of the alphabet in signals to or from ships. It is a 
          component of the International Code of Signals (INTERCO).

          There are various methods that the flags can be used as signals:
        </P>
        <UL>
          <LI>
            Each flag spells out an alphabetic message, letter by letter.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            Individual flags have specific and standard meanings; for example, diving 
            support vessels raise 		    the "A flag" indicating their inability to move 
            from their current location because 				they have a diver underwater.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            One or more flags form a code word whose meaning can be looked up in a 
            code book held by both 		    parties. An example is the Popham numeric code 
            used at the Battle of Trafalgar.
          </LI>
        </UL>
        <P>
          NATO uses the same flags, with a few unique to warships, alone or in  short 
          sets to communicate various unclassified messages. The NATO usage  generally 
          differs from the International meanings, and therefore  warships will fly the 
          Code/Answer flag above the signal to indicate it  should be read using the 
          International meaning.
