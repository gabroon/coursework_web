It is most  commonly used to \n          symbolize a country. The term flag is also used to  refer to the graphic design \n          employed by a flag, or to its depiction in  another medium. Flags are also used \n          in messaging, advertising, or for  other decorative purposes. The study of flags \n          is known as  \n          <STRONG>\n            vexillology\n          </STRONG>\n          , from the Latin \n          <EM>\n            vexillum\n          </EM>\n          \n          meaning  flag or banner.\n        </P>\n      </DIV>\n      <HR>\n      <DIV id=\"history\">\n        <H2>\n          <SPAN class=\"box\">\n          </SPAN>\n          History\n        </H2>\n        <DIV id=\"photobadge\">\n          <A href=\"http://www.flickriver.com/photos/tags/flag/interesting/\">\n            <IMG class=\"flickrImage\"\n            title=\"View most interesting 'flag' photos on Flickriver\" alt=\"View most interesting 'flag' photos on Flickriver\" \n            src=\"Flags_files/flag.jpg\">\n          </A>\n        </DIV>\n        <P>\n          The origin of modern flags lies in our remote prehistoric past. When  people \n          started to form large groups to live and hunt together, they  appointed a leader \n          to rule them and settle disputes. As a mark of office  this leader would wear \n          some sort of ceremonial head-dress and hold a  long decorative staff, rod or \n          spear, topped with an ornament or tribal  emblem. The staff was also used as a \n          visible sign to rally around, or to  point out the direction of a march or \n          attack. This prehistoric, or  proto-flag, is known as a vexilloid. \n        </P>\n        <P>\n          Later in Ancient China, a different tradition developed when silk was \n          invented between 6000 and 3000 BC. This strong, light fabric was ideal  for \n          making banners, which were much easier to carry than the vexilloids  that had \n          been used earlier, and they were also easier to see from a  distance. \n        </P>\n        <P>\n          From Ancient China the use of fabric flags spread to Mongolia, Japan,  Korea, \n          India, Persia, Ancient Greece, and finally the Roman Empire and  the rest of \n          Europe.\n        </P>\n        <P>\n          During the Middle Ages, flags were used for a variety of purposes  including: \n          identification of members of nobility, guilds, cities,  religious worship, and \n          for use during battles. In battle, flags were  used by military companies for \n          identification on the field and relaying  of strategic instructions. \n        </P>\n        <P>\n          From the era of sailing vessels onwards, it has been customary (and  later a \n          legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their  nationality. \n          These flags eventually evolved into the national flags and  maritime flags of \n          today. Flags also became the preferred means of  communications at sea, \n          resulting in various systems of flag signals (see  \n          <A href=\"https://blackboard.ncl.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-1842369-dt-content-rid-5822437_1/courses/O1415-CSC8004/Chris/Assessment/flags-XHTML.html#maritime\">\n            International \n            Maritime Signal Flags\n          </A>\n          )\n        </P>\n      </DIV>\n      <HR>\n      <DIV id=\"national\">\n        <H2>\n          <SPAN class=\"box\">\n          </SPAN>\n          National Flags\n        </H2>\n        <DIV id=\"nationalText\">\n          <P>\n            One of the most popular uses of a flag is to symbolize a nation or  country. \n            Some national flags have been particularly inspirational to  other nations, \n            countries, or subnational entities in the design of their  own flags. \n          </P>\n          <P>\n            Some interesting national flag facts include:\n          </P>\n          <UL>\n            <LI>\n              The Tricolour of The Netherlands is the oldest tricolor, first appearing \n              in 1572 as the Prince's Flag in orange – white – blue.\n            </LI>\n            <LI>\n              The flag of Denmark is the oldest state flag still in use.\n            </LI>\n            <LI>\n              The flag of Nepal is the only national flag that is not \n              rectangular.\n            </LI>\n          </UL>\n        </DIV>\n        <SPAN id=\"nationalFlags\">\n        </SPAN>\n      </DIV>\n      <HR>\n      <DIV id=\"maritime\">\n        <H2>\n          <SPAN class=\"box\">\n          </SPAN>\n          International Maritime Signal Flags\n        </H2>\n        <P>\n          From the era of sailing vessels onwards, it has been customary (and  later a \n          legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their  nationality, \n          these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and  maritime flags of \n          today.
