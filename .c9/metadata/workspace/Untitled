When \npeople started to form large groups to live and hunt together, they \nappointed a leader to rule them and settle disputes. As a mark of office \nthis leader would wear some sort of ceremonial head-dress and hold a \nlong decorative staff, rod or spear, topped with an ornament or tribal \nemblem. The staff was also used as a visible sign to rally around, or to \npoint out the direction of a march or attack. This prehistoric, or \nproto-flag, is known as a vexilloid. </p> \n\n<p>Later in Ancient China, a different tradition developed when silk was \ninvented between 6000 and 3000 BC. This strong, light fabric was ideal \nfor making banners, which were much easier to carry than the vexilloids \nthat had been used earlier, and they were also easier to see from a \ndistance. </p> \n\n<p>From Ancient China the use of fabric flags spread to Mongolia, Japan, \nKorea, India, Persia, Ancient Greece, and finally the Roman Empire and \nthe rest of Europe.</p> \n\n<p>During the Middle Ages, flags were used for a variety of purposes \nincluding: identification of members of nobility, guilds, cities, \nreligious worship, and for use during battles. In battle, flags were \nused by military companies for identification on the field and relaying \nof strategic instructions. </p> \n\n<p>From the era of sailing vessels onwards, it has been customary (and \nlater a legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their \nnationality.
