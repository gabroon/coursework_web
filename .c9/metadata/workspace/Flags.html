It is most commonly used to symbolize\n      a country. The term flag is also used to refer to the graphic design employed by a\n      flag, or to its depiction in another medium. Flags are also used in messaging,\n      advertising, or for other decorative purposes. The study of flags is known as\n      <strong>vexillology</strong> , from the Latin <em>vexillum</em> meaning flag or\n      banner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <hr />\n\n    <div id=\"history\">\n      <h2>History</h2>\n\n      <div id=\"photobadge\">\n        <a href=\"http://www.flickriver.com/photos/tags/flag/interesting/\"><img class=\n        \"flickrImage\" title=\"View most interesting 'flag' photos on Flickriver\" alt=\n        \"View most interesting 'flag' photos on Flickriver\" src=\n        \"Flags_files/flag.jpg\" /></a>\n      </div>\n\n      <p>The origin of modern flags lies in our remote prehistoric past. When people\n      started to form large groups to live and hunt together, they appointed a leader to\n      rule them and settle disputes. As a mark of office this leader would wear some sort\n      of ceremonial head-dress and hold a long decorative staff, rod or spear, topped\n      with an ornament or tribal emblem. The staff was also used as a visible sign to\n      rally around, or to point out the direction of a march or attack. This prehistoric,\n      or proto-flag, is known as a vexilloid.</p>\n\n      <p>Later in Ancient China, a different tradition developed when silk was invented\n      between 6000 and 3000 BC. This strong, light fabric was ideal for making banners,\n      which were much easier to carry than the vexilloids that had been used earlier, and\n      they were also easier to see from a distance.</p>\n\n      <p>From Ancient China the use of fabric flags spread to Mongolia, Japan, Korea,\n      India, Persia, Ancient Greece, and finally the Roman Empire and the rest of\n      Europe.</p>\n\n      <p>During the Middle Ages, flags were used for a variety of purposes including:\n      identification of members of nobility, guilds, cities, religious worship, and for\n      use during battles. In battle, flags were used by military companies for\n      identification on the field and relaying of strategic instructions.</p>\n\n      <p>From the era of sailing vessels onwards, it has been customary (and later a\n      legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality. These\n      flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today. Flags\n      also became the preferred means of communications at sea, resulting in various\n      systems of flag signals (see <a href=\"#maritime\">International Maritime Signal\n      Flags</a> )</p>\n    </div>\n    <hr />\n\n    <div id=\"national\">\n      <h2>National Flags</h2>\n\n      <div id=\"nationalText\">\n        <p>One of the most popular uses of a flag is to symbolize a nation or country.\n        Some national flags have been particularly inspirational to other nations,\n        countries, or subnational entities in the design of their own flags.</p>\n\n        <p>Some interesting national flag facts include:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>The Tricolour of The Netherlands is the oldest tricolor, first appearing in\n          1572 as the Prince's Flag in orange &ndash; white &ndash; blue.</li>\n\n          <li>The flag of Denmark is the oldest state flag still in use.</li>\n\n          <li>The flag of Nepal is the only national flag that is not rectangular.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div><span id=\"nationalFlags\"></span>\n    </div>\n    <hr />\n\n    <div id=\"maritime\">\n      <h2>International Maritime Signal Flags</h2>\n\n      <p>From the era of sailing vessels onwards, it has been customary (and later a\n      legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality, these\n      flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today.

An example is the Popham numeric code used at the\n        Battle of Trafalgar.</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>NATO uses the same flags, with a few unique to warships, alone or in short sets\n      to communicate various unclassified messages. The NATO usage generally differs from\n      the International meanings, and therefore warships will fly the Code/Answer flag\n      above the signal to indicate it should be read using the International meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div id=\"letters\">\n      <h3>Maritme Signals: Letters</h3>\n\n      <p>A - Alpha<br />\n      <img src=\n

Flags are also used in messaging,","      advertising, or for other decorative purposes. The study of flags is known as","      <strong>vexillology</strong> , from the Latin <em>vexillum</em> meaning flag or","      banner.</p>","    </div>","    <hr />","","    <div id=\"history\">","      <h2>History</h2>","","      <div id=\"photobadge\">","        <a href=\"http://www.flickriver.com/photos/tags/flag/interesting/\"><img class=","        \"flickrImage\" title=\"View most interesting 'flag' photos on Flickriver\" alt=","        \"View most interesting 'flag' photos on Flickriver\" src=","        \"Flags_files/flag.jpg\" /></a>","      </div>","","      <p>The origin of modern flags lies in our remote prehistoric past. When people","      started to form large groups to live and hunt together, they appointed a leader to","      rule them and settle disputes. As a mark of office this leader would wear some sort","      of ceremonial head-dress and hold a long decorative staff, rod or spear, topped","      with an ornament or tribal emblem. The staff was also used as a visible sign to","      rally around, or to point out the direction of a march or attack. This prehistoric,","      or proto-flag, is known as a vexilloid.</p>","","      <p>Later in Ancient China, a different tradition developed when silk was invented","      between 6000 and 3000 BC. This strong, light fabric was ideal for making banners,","      which were much easier to carry than the vexilloids that had been used earlier, and","      they were also easier to see from a distance.</p>","","      <p>From Ancient China the use of fabric flags spread to Mongolia, Japan, Korea,","      India, Persia, Ancient Greece, and finally the Roman Empire and the rest of","      Europe.</p>","","      <p>During the Middle Ages, flags were used for a variety of purposes including:","      identification of members of nobility, guilds, cities, religious worship, and for","      use during battles. In battle, flags were used by military companies for","      identification on the field and relaying of strategic instructions.</p>","","      <p>From the era of sailing vessels onwards, it has been customary (and later a","      legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality. These","      flags eventually evolved into the national flags and maritime flags of today.
